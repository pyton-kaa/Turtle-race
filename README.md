# Turtle-race
Turtles run around the stadium, you bet the winner

## How it works
First you set the stadium parameters: radius, length, number of lane and lane width. The program prevents you from chosing inappropriate values.

After the stadium has been drawn, you choose the number of turtles-runners and bet the color of the winner.

The turtles run at random pace (all have the same distribution). During the whole race, the leader and vice-leader are presented on a scoreboard, together with the actual distance between them.

When the first turtle touches the finish line, the race ends. You are informed if your bet was correct.

## What did I practice?

- Designing a scalable program (working with a wide range of values of a few parameters given on input)
- Graphical interface creation with Turtle Graphics
- Creating classes and multiple objects from a class
- Conditional instructions
- Handling approximation issues of measuring the arc length
